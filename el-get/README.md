New el-get based installer
--------------------------

Setup is the same as before:
* Clone this repository
* Run make

The concept behind this repository is around modules
* A module represents some feature' in it's entirety
* It can be a programming language, a theme or anything else

The enabled-modules file is a list (\n separated) of modules you want enabled

You can see sample-enabled-modules/gja-enabled-modules for an example
